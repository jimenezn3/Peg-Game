# Peg-Game

Implements the strategy game, Peg Game, and solves it in the perfect amount of moves. The board is arranged in a triangular grid with 13 holes, 12 of which have pegs. The purpose is to remove pegs by jumping taking one and "jumping" over an adjacent peg. The game ends when there is only one peg left (winning scenario) or no other moves are possible (losing scenario).
